Web-Performance-Metrics-Tool
============================
There is a growing interest in software tools that can analyze code as it is being written. In this project, a static analysis tool based on software metrics, has been presented. The most important feature of the tool is its extendibility: it is straightforward to add new metrics simply by writing a script using Python language. In this way, a metrics researcher needs to deal with a high level, metrics-oriented, intermediate representation when adding or modifying metrics to calculate. This spares the researcher from having to know intimidating language parsing concepts such as declaration, class specifiers, and base clauses. Future enhancements of the system will include rule based analysis in order to check the code for adherence to best programming practices. The integration with most widely used IDEs such as Eclipse, JBuilder, Netbeans, Microsoft Visual Studio, will provide another relevant enhancement. A parser for the C# language is under development and it will be integrated into a future version of the tool.
